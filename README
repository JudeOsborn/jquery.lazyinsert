JQuery Lazy Insert
==================

A jQuery plugin to insert image elements when they appear on screen.

Removes them when they are not visible. Useful for pages with a LOT of images.

Usage
------

Apply to image containers, such as a div, specifying the image to insert in the data-image attribute:

	<div class="image-container" data-image="some_image.jpg"></div>

JavaScript declaration
----------------------

	$('.image-container').lazyinsert({
		container: <jquery scrolling container (or window if not specficied)>,
		threshold: <An offset in pixels, to allow Lazy Insert to do its magic before an item comes on screen>,
		throttle: <Optionally throttles the scroll event for performance. Requires the jquery.ba-throttle-debounce" plug-in>
	});

<img> tags will be inserted into ".image-container" when the element comes into view, and removed when it scrolls off page.
